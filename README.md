## A jQuery slider plugin
I created this plugin because the slider plugins I found on the internet were all very "fat" and I just wanted a very
thin slider plugin that is extensible by making use of custom events.

## What still needs to be done
Circular/auto-reverse
Paging

## Notes
The index keeps incrementing till the animation is finished.
There is a problem when the slider is animating and the the sliderReverse event is fired constantly
Keep track of the position that is not the actual position
