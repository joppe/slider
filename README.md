## What to do with loop
Loop: none/auto/circular

## What to do with an already active element
Position the $slider element

## What to do with the last item active !DONE!

TODO
loopMode implementation

?direction, so you know which direction you want to navigate to?

What to do with active index? Should I use a index to figure out what slide has the focus?

The index should be a kind of pages that are visible
